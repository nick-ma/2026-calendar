Ah, mes amis, welcome to the Louvre, the heart of art and history!

We begin with La Joconde—the Mona Lisa. Her smile, so mysterious… Léonard de Vinci captured something eternal here, incroyable!

Now, Le Radeau de la Méduse—Géricault's dramatic masterpiece. Look at the pain, the movement… this is more than a painting, it is a tragedy frozen in time.

And here, La Liberté guidant le peuple—Delacroix's vision of revolution! Passion, struggle, triumph—all in one canvas.

Feel it… This, mes amis, is art! Shall we continue?
